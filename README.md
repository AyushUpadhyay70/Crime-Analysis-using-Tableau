Problem Scenario: Crime analysis is important for law-and-order maintenance at any place. It helps the police department and law enforcement agencies to identify patterns of crime, which is crucial for the effective planning of a crime prevention program. The purpose of crime data analysis is to support the operations of the police department, like criminal investigation, apprehension, prosecution, and development of crime prevention and reduction strategies.

Problem objective: You should prepare a dashboard to keep the police department and the city updated on the statistics of crime events. You are required to create a dashboard/story using Tableau for the communication website. Pay attention to data storytelling.
